# Simulation-of-particle

## Winnowing

The positioning of the bin separation point to compeletely seggregate the chaff and the grain is hard pile. Diiferent simulation were performed, such as Euler, Rungakutta and Monte carlo to obtain the trajectory of the particle. Thereby,  drafting the suitable positioning point and jet flow velocity for complete separation.

## Collision

The collision of the two spherical particle are simulated, considering Hard and soft sphere alogorithm. The result provide the berif insigt about the collision time, overlapping and the final position of the particle.
